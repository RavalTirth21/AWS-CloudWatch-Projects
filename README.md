# 📊 AWS CloudWatch Practicals 

Welcome to my collection of hands-on **AWS CloudWatch** projects!  
These practicals helped me understand how to monitor and manage AWS resources using alarms, logs, agents, and insights. I implemented these as part of my learning to gain practical experience in AWS monitoring.
